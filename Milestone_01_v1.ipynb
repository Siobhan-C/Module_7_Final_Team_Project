        "\n",
        "This milestone is the first phase of your project. You’ll begin working in teams, select your dataset, perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA), and frame your classification problem.  \n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Form your project team.**  \n",
        "   Convene your team and complete the **Team Contract** (available in your Homework Repository). This is **due on Sunday, October 19th** at midnight (along with Homework 07). Each member must review and sign it before submission.\n",

You are not required to build a model yet (that will happen in Milestone 2) but of course you have lots of example models to choose from previous Homeworks and Coding Notebooks and you may wish to explore a baseline model as you do this first phase of your project.\n",

        "#### **2. HuffPost News Category (Text)**  \n",
        "Roughly **200,000 short news items** labeled into **41 topical categories** (e.g., *POLITICS*, *ENTERTAINMENT*, *PARENTING*).  \n",
        "Each record contains a **headline**, a **short description**, which we will concatenate with a separator token to make a single text string:\n",
        "> `\"headline [SEP] short_description\"`.\n",

        "In this problem, you will explore the two provided datasets and select one to use for your final project.  \n",
        "Your goal is to understand the structure, content, and challenges of the dataset through basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).  \n",
        "By the end of this Milestone notebook, you should be able to explain what makes the dataset interesting, identify potential modeling challenges (e.g., imbalance, ambiguity, quality issues), and justify why it is a good choice for your classification project.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### What to Do\n",
        "1. **Load both datasets** and examine the outputs of the template code provided.  \n",
        "   After this brief inspection, **choose one dataset for your project** and **delete the template code for the other.**  For your chosen dataset, continue with the remaining steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Inspect** the dataset's basic properties:  \n",
        "   - **Number of samples and classes:**  \n",
        "     Determine how many total examples and distinct categories are present. Verify that the counts match expectations (e.g., 101 food classes or 41 news topics).  \n",
        "   - **Example records or images:**  \n",
        "     View several samples to understand the input format, diversity, and potential quality issues.  \n",
        "     For images, note lighting or composition differences; for text, read a few headlines and summaries to see how expressive they are (done for you in template code).\n",
        "   - **Distribution of labels (check for imbalance):**  \n",
        "     Plot or tabulate label frequencies to see whether some classes dominate. Imbalanced datasets can bias model training and may require special handling.  \n",
        "   - **Missing or inconsistent data:**  \n",
        "     Look for empty fields, unreadable images, duplicate entries, or mislabeled samples. Handle or document any issues you find.  \n",
        "   - **Overlapping or ambiguous class labels:**  \n",
        "     Identify categories that may not be clearly distinct—e.g., “apple pie” vs. “cheesecake,” or “POLITICS” vs. “WORLD NEWS.”  \n",
        "     Ambiguity in labels can increase confusion between classes and reduce model accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Visualize key aspects:**  \n",
        "   Extend the template code to complete the EDA for your chosen dataset:  \n",
        "   - **Images:**  \n",
        "     Create visual summaries to better understand the data (some are implemented in the template code).  \n",
        "     - Verify that the dataset is balanced across classes.  \n",
        "     - Display a small grid of random images to check variation in appearance, composition, and background (done in template code).  \n",
        "     - Compare image sizes to determine whether resizing or normalization will be needed.  \n",
        "     - Examine lighting and color balance—many web-scraped photos vary widely in brightness, saturation, and white balance.  \n",
        "   - **Text:**  \n",
        "     Visualize class balance and linguistic properties (some implemented in the template code).  \n",
        "     - Plot the number of samples per label to confirm class balance or imbalance.  \n",
        "     - Compute basic text statistics such as average word count or vocabulary size.  \n",
        "     - Examine examples for duplicates, near-duplicates, or entries that might fit multiple categories.  \n",
        "     - *(Optional)* Generate a word-frequency plot or word cloud to highlight distinctive terms for a few classes.\n",

While \"POLITICS\" is the most frequent category with over 32,000 examples, several categories like \"EDUCATION\", \"CULTURE & ARTS\", and \"LATINO VOICES\" have around 1,000 or fewer examples. This imbalance will likely be a challenge for model training since models can overfit to majority classes and underperform on small one.\n",

        "   * **Length/size variance:**\n",
        "     For text, show length percentiles (50/75/90/95) and estimate truncation rate at candidate `max_text_length`s (e.g., 256/300/512). For images, summarize native resolutions.\n",
        "   * **Noise/duplicates/leakage:**\n",
        "     Note empty or malformed items, near-duplicates, and how you would prevent cross-split leakage.\n",
        "   * **Ambiguous/overlapping labels:**\n",

        "   * **Compute constraints:**\n",
        "     Briefly state limits (RAM/GPU/CPU) that might affect batch size, sequence length, or image size.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Map each challenge to a concrete solution plan:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   Examples:\n",
        "   * **Imbalance →** `class_weight` or oversampling; report which one you’d try first and why.\n",
        "   * **Length/size →** pick a target `max_text_length` (e.g., 95th percentile) with masking; for images, standardize resize/crop and basic augmentation.\n",
        "   * **Noise/duplicates →** dedupe (hash/near-dup), drop empty/very short items, document any relabeling.\n",
        "   * **Ambiguity →** consider merging labels (if justified), or add features (bigrams/char-ngrams; simple image augmentations).\n",
        "   * **Overfitting risk →** early stopping on your primary metric, dropout/weight decay, freeze-then-finetune plan (for pretrained features).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Explore appropriate evaluation metrics:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   Examples:\n",
        "   * **Primary metric:** pick one aligned to your data (e.g., **macro-F1** if imbalanced; accuracy if balanced).\n",
        "   * **Secondary metric(s):** per-class precision/recall, confusion matrix.\n",
